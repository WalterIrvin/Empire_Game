# Recipe dictionary
# When setting up an item/inbuilt inventory to be a crafting point, it will have a list of valid recipes it can make.
# The syntax is
# recipe_id,[id:amt],...;craft_id
# recipe_id: used to refer to the id when giving a crafting item recipes (for example a furance might have a recipe_id = 12 for burning iron ore to iron bars)
# [id:amt]: refers to an actual id found in the Globals.Global_Item_Dictionary, along with how much of that item. (note you can have a recipe with just one item)
# ;: splits the id:amt section from the final section
# craft_id: the actual item that is crafted from this recipe
